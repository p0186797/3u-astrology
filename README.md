Create a file called **astrology.py** and upload it to this repo.

Write a program that takes in the user's year of birth and outputs their elemental zodiac. Their elemental zodiac consists of an element (Metal, Fire, Wood, Water, Earth) and an animal (Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig).

To figure out your element, **look at the last digit of your birth year**.

- 0 or 1, your element is metal
- 2 or 3, your element is water
- 4 or 5, your element is wood
- 6 or 7, your element is fire
- 8 or 9, your element is earth

To figure out your zodiac animal use the below chart. The Chinese zodiac repeats every 12 years. For example, 2008 + 12 = 2020 is also the year of the rat.
